                    <p><a href="https://www.memphistours.com/Egypt/Egypt-Wikis/Egypt-Pyramids/wiki/pyramids" target="_blank">The Egyptian Pyramids</a> are described as pyramid-shaped monuments, constructed mostly as funerary
                        tombs
                        and
                        ceremonial complexes for the departed pharaohs during the Old Kingdom (2575 BC to 2150 BC) and
                        Middle
                        Kingdom (2050-1550 BC) periods.
                        To date, approximately 118 pyramids of various definitions have been discovered across Egypt
                        (although
                        sources differ with some citing 138), mainly sited on the west bank of the River Nile and
                        grouped
                        into
                        several clusters or pyramid fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pyramid, in architecture, a monumental structure constructed of or faced with stone or brick and
                        having a
                        rectangular base and four sloping triangular (or sometimes trapezoidal) sides meeting at an apex
                        (or
                        truncated to form a platform).

                        deceased and his family.

                    <h3>How were the pyramids built?</h3>
                    <p>One of history's most ancient and unsolved puzzles is the construction of the pyramids. How were
                        the
                        Egyptian Pyramids built? Again and again, over the course of history, many scholars and
                        scientists
                        asked
                        and wondered the same question of 'how the pyramids were built.
                    </p>
                    <p>The general theory is based on the belief that the huge stones were carved from the quarries
                        using
                        copper
                        chisels. Then, these blocks were dragged and lifted into position. However, the method regarding
                        the
                        movement and placement of these stones is under great dispute.



                        The techniques that were used in the process of constructing the Egyptian pyramids have baffled
                        and
                        puzzled many historians and scientists for countless years. Many controversial hypotheses were
                        introduced regarding the construction of the pyramids.



                        The form of the workforce is also under a huge debate. It is believed that the pyramids were
                        constructed
                        using slave labor and another theory suggests that the pyramids were builds by tens of thousands
                        of
                        free
                        skilled workers that worked for a salary.



                        What is certain is that the workforce was highly organized and managed to the highest level by
                        following
                        an organized and planned process that consisted of three phases.
                    </p>


                    <p>Now, a team of engineers and geologists brings a new theory to the table — a hydraulic lift
                        device that
                        would have floated the heavy stones up through the middle of Egypt’s oldest pyramid using stored
                        water.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What's inside piramids?</h3>
                    <p>The pyramids are mostly solid on the inside, but there are passageways, rooms, and burial
                        chambers, some
                        open to the public, and some yet to be accessed.
                        Egypt's pharaohs expected to become gods in the afterlife. To prepare for the next world they
                        erected
                        temples to the gods and massive pyramid tombs for themselves—filled with all the things each
                        ruler would
                        need to guide and sustain himself in the next world.

            <h2>The Pyramids of Giza</h2>
            <div class="pyramids">
                

                <div class="block">
                    <p>The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid,
                        the
                        Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes
                        and
                        the
                        Great Sphinx. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt,
                        between
                        c. 2600 – c. 2500 BC. The site also includes several temples, cemeteries, and the remains of a
                        workers'
                        village.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It served as the tomb of pharaoh
                        Khufu,
                        who
                        ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.
                        The Great Pyramid, or the Pyramid of Khufu, is the oldest and the tallest of the three pyramids
                        towering
                        over Giza. Constructed c. 2551–2528 BCE, it originally stood at 481.4 feet (147 meters), or
                        about 45
                        stories. Its immense size makes it a marvel to behold, but the Great Pyramid, and its neighbors,
                        the
                        Pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure, are mostly just solid masses of stone—2.3 million blocks of cut
                        limestone, to be more precise, which is the approximate number making up the Great Pyramid. All
                        three
                        pyramids would originally have had an outer casing of lighter limestone, as seen on the cap of
                        Khafre’s
                        pyramid. We can only imagine how the gleaming white limestone would have made the pyramids an
                        even
                        more
                        dazzling spectacle than they are now.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although the Great Pyramid has subterranean chambers, they were never completed, and Khufu’s
                        sarcophagus rests in the King’s Chamber, where Napoleon is said to have sojourned, deep inside
                        the Great Pyramid.

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>The entrance to the Pyramid</span>The original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the
                            north of the structure, standing 17 metres above ground level. From this original entrance,
                            there is a Descending Passage which goes down at an angle through the masonry of the pyramid
                            and into the bedrock beneath it.

                            There is a continuation of the horizontal passage that leads to a chamber close to the
                            entrance, there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists believe
                            that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu
                            later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>The Queen’s Chamber</span>The Queen's Chamber is exactly halfway between the north and
                            south faces of the pyramid. At the eastern end of the chamber, there is a niche 4 metres
                            high. The original depth of the niche was 1 metre deep but has since been deepened by
                            treasure hunters.

                            In the north and south walls of the Queen's Chamber, there are shafts, which, unlike those
                            in the King's Chamber that immediately slope upwards, are horizontal for around 2 metres
                            before sloping steeply upwards, their purpose is unknown. At the end of one of the shafts, a
                            ball of black diorite (a type of rock) and a bronze implement of unknown purpose were
                            discovered by explorers.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>The Grand Gallery</span>The Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage
                            towards the top of the pyramid. At the base, it is 2 metres wide.

                            The floor of the Grand Gallery consists of a step on either side, 51 centimetres wide, In
                            the step there are 54 slots that form a cross shape rising out of the slot in the shelf. The
                            purpose of these slots is not known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery,
                            which is the same width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking
                            stones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them
                            from sliding down the passage.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>The King’s Chamber</span>The King's Chamber is 10 metres from east to west and 5
                            metres from north to south. Raised from the floor, there are two narrow shafts in the north
                            and south walls. The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear to be aligned towards
                            stars or areas of the northern and southern skies. They were long believed by Egyptologists
                            to be air shafts for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of
                            the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the Pharaoh’s
                            spirit to paradise.

                            The only object in the King's Chamber is a rectangular granite sarcophagus, one corner of
                            which is broken. The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which
                            indicates that it must have been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put in place.

                            Historians do not know in reality if Khufu is entombed in the Great Pyramid of Giza.
                            The Pyramid at Giza actually holds two burial chambers. One lies directly beneath the
                            construction, as was the norm with other pyramids. The second burial chamber is placed at a
                            height of about 42 metres, and is attached to many smaller chambers that haven't been fully
                            explored. Whether Khufu was buried in one of these chambers, or whether he died in such a
                            way that his body was lost, we do not know.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>The Robbers' Tunnel</span>Nowadays, to get inside the Pyramid of Giza, you have to use
                            what’s known as the Robber’s Tunnel. This tunnel was cut into the original masonry of the
                            pyramid, around 7 metres above the base of the structure. The Robber’s Tunnel runs primarily
                            in a straight, horizontal line for around 27 metres and then makes a sharp left turn as it
                            hits the Ascending Passage.

                            Interestingly, the Robber’s Tunnel was not part of the original design of the Great Pyramid.
                            This means that it was cut into the inside of the Pyramid of Giza in the years following its
                            construction.

                            There are a couple of theories as to how the tunnel got made. The first theory argues that
                            the Caliph Abdallah al-Mamun was responsible for its construction. The other theory,
                            howeveqr, does not credit him with its build.
